## 🌊 The Vibe (About Me)
I am a Computer Science Engineering student specializing in **AI & ML**, but my approach is defined by **Vibe Coding**.

For me, coding isn't just syntax—it's about **maintaining flow, curiosity, and creativity** while shipping production-ready systems. I bridge the gap between disciplined engineering and the "art" of development, ensuring that my code is as clean as the logic behind it. Whether I'm training a neural network or building a full-stack web app, I bring a focus on thoughtful system design and user-centric problem solving.
